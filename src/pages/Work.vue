        These are the big projects. With strong, tangible results. But it's IC level work. All of it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black dark:text-white text-body mb-6">
        Creating a case study for strategy work is challenging. How do you capture the opportunity sizing of an idea or the nuances of aligning stakeholders? These moments all happen behind the scenes, invisible in metrics or screenshots. But, case studies demand tangible outcomes with polished deliverables.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black dark:text-white text-body mb-6">
        Strategy work is often a mosaic of mentoring teams, earning buy-in, and iterating endlessly. Not every effort leads to a case study-worthy success. Failed experiments, minor optimizations, and scrapped ideas are just as integral to the process, even if they don't shine in a portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black dark:text-white text-body mb-6">
        This is just a collection of impactful projects, but they're just pieces of the bigger story. If you want to dive into the unseen layers of cross-team collaboration, presentations to executives, or anything in between, I'd love to chat.
